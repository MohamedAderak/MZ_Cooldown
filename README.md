# MZ-Cooldown

# Description

    This particular script adds a new command called /cooldown.
    This command allows police officers to start a cooldown timer, which will prevent them from using certain commands for a specified period of time. 
    This can be useful for preventing police officers from abusing their powers.

    The script also includes a HUD element that displays the current priority cooldown timer. 
    This helps police officers keep track of how much time is left on their cooldown timer.


## Installation

### Manual

- put it in the `[qb] -> qb-smallresources -> client` directory.
